### Day 0: 

### Day 1: Wednesday 07/08
**Today**
Going to spin up react app, and have it hosted somemwhere. I have a spare domain that I haven't really used since I got it. So I will use that to see if I can pop something up there.

First thoughts for now are a surf reporting site, hopefully scraping some live data into a interface. But lets just setup a skeleton, not really worried about an API at the moment so will work with some hard coded JSON files.

Problems problems haha, first had to setup github ssh keys and then it's time to setup node using nvm. More issues, something wrongwith node version/npm. OK sorted

created app using crete react app, going to choose what style to use. Setup linting rules using eslint.
