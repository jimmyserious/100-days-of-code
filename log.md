### Day 0: 06/01/2023

**Today's Progress**: Today is about making the plan not a coding day, jsut setting the activities and structure of what I am to do up

**Thoughts:** I struggle with the links everywhere, I just want to keep this simple and keep coding.

**Link to work:** No work to show today

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
